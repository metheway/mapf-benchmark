# mapf-benchmark
A benchmarking tool for researchers working on multi-agent path finding.

### Currently implemented algorithms:
  * [Conflict-based search](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/view/5062/) (Sharon, et al.)
  * [Independence Detection](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1926) (Standley)
  * Cooperative A*
  * Multi-agent A*
  
### Dependencies
Requires Java 8.

There are no external library dependencies. All of the lower-level infrastructure can be found in the `utilities` package.

### Disclaimer
This project is in progress. Visualization of paths and maps will be provided soon.
